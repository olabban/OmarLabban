# About Me

Omar Labban is a Ph.D. Candidate in Mechanical Engineering interested in the application of science and engineering across disciplines to problems of real-world concern. His research, supervised by [Professor John H. Lienhard](http://meche.mit.edu/people/faculty/LIENHARD@MIT.EDU), focuses on the intersection of membrane technology with thermal sciences and solid mechanics, targeting challenges in water, energy, and sustainability. 

At MIT, Omar was named a J-WAFS fellow, received a Pappalardo fellowship, and served as the Vice-President of Budget for the MIT Energy Club. Prior to joining MIT, his interests focused on product design and computational engineering.
